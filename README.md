- 🏠 Born and raised in Brazil, now proudly calling Vancouver my home for the past 6 years.
- 📚 I’m currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Economics from The University Of British Columbia
- 🍲 Mastering the art of culinary pyrotechnics in my free time 🔥 (I swear, I'm just trying to cook!)
- 📺 A devout follower of political TV shows, like Scandal and VEEP
- 🌞 Great believer that the sun has a magical way of making problems disappear (though, perhaps, I just convinced myself of that).
- 🌴 Highlight of 2024: A memorable getaway to Cancun, Mexico with my boyfriend & grandma, where every moment was soaked in sunshine.
